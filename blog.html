              <strong>The difference of map(), filter(), and forEach() is</strong>  are all higher-order functions in JavaScript that are used to iterate over arrays and perform some operations on them.<br> <br>

              <strong>map()</strong> - returns a new array with the same number of elements as the original array, but with each element transformed according to a given function. The original array is not modified. <br> <br>
              
              <strong>filter()</strong> - returns a new array that contains only the elements from the original array that pass a given test function. The original array is not modified. <br> <br>
              
              <strong>forEach()</strong> - simply iterates over the array and executes a given function for each element, but it does not return anything. The original array is not modified.

                <strong>Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies are all client-side storage options available in web browsers. Each of them has their own characteristics and use cases. Here are the differences:</strong> <br><br>
                <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Local Storage is a mechanism to store data in the browser and persists even after the browser is closed. The data is stored in key-value pairs and can be accessed and modified by JavaScript. It has a storage limit of about 5-10 MB depending on the browser. <br> <br>
                <strong>Session Storage:</strong> Session Storage is similar to Local Storage in that it stores data in the browser. However, the data stored in Session Storage is cleared when the user closes the browser or the tab. Like Local Storage, Session Storage is also used to store user preferences or application state information, but only for the duration of the session. <br> <br>
                <strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are small text files that are stored on the client's computer by a website. Cookies can be used to store information about the user or their preferences, such as their username or language preference. Cookies have a maximum size limit of 4KB and can be set to expire after a specified period of time.
