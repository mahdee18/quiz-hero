            <h5>Answer is:</h5>
            <strong>The difference of map(), filter(), and forEach() is</strong> are all higher-order functions in
            JavaScript that are used to iterate over arrays and perform some operations on them.<br> <br>

            <strong>map()</strong> - returns a new array with the same number of elements as the original array, but
            with each element transformed according to a given function. The original array is not modified. <br> <br>

            <strong>filter()</strong> - returns a new array that contains only the elements from the original array that
            pass a given test function. The original array is not modified. <br> <br>

            <strong>forEach()</strong> - simply iterates over the array and executes a given function for each element,
            but it does not return anything. The original array is not modified. <br> <br>

            <strong>find()</strong> - The find() method returns the first element in the array that satisfies a given
            condition specified by the callback function. If no element satisfies the condition, find() returns
            undefined. The original array is not modified.

            <h5>Answer is:</h5>
            <strong>Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies are all client-side storage options available in web
              browsers. Each of them has their own characteristics and use cases. Here are the differences:</strong>
            <br><br>
            <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Local Storage is a mechanism to store data in the browser and persists even
            after the browser is closed. The data is stored in key-value pairs and can be accessed and modified by
            JavaScript. It has a storage limit of about 5-10 MB depending on the browser. <br> <br>
            <strong>Session Storage:</strong> Session Storage is similar to Local Storage in that it stores data in the
            browser. However, the data stored in Session Storage is cleared when the user closes the browser or the tab.
            Like Local Storage, Session Storage is also used to store user preferences or application state information,
            but only for the duration of the session. <br> <br>
            <strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are small text files that are stored on the client's computer by a
            website. Cookies can be used to store information about the user or their preferences, such as their
            username or language preference. Cookies have a maximum size limit of 4KB and can be set to expire after a
            specified period of time.

            <h5>Answer is:</h5>
            The Event Loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that manages the execution of code in a single-threaded
            environment and allows for non-blocking asynchronous operations by continuously checking the call stack and
            task queue. It ensures that JavaScript code runs efficiently and effectively. <br> <br>
            <strong>In summary,</strong> the Event Loop is a mechanism that manages the execution of code in a
            single-threaded environment and ensures that asynchronous operations in JavaScript are executed efficiently
            and non-blockingly.

            <h5>Answer is:</h5>
            The quizTimer() function is a JavaScript function that is typically used to create a countdown timer for a
            quiz application or other time-sensitive application. The function uses the setInterval() method to execute
            a callback function every seconds and updates an HTML element with an ID of count to display the remaining
            time in minutes and seconds. <br> <br>
            In addition to updating the time, the function changes the color of the timer every 60 seconds to alert the
            user of the remaining time. If the timer is at a multiple of 60 seconds, the text color of the timer changes
            to red. If the timer is at an odd second within a minute, the text color of the timer changes to a lighter
            shade of red.
            <br><br>
            The quizTimer() function takes a boolean argument called dismiss, which is used to start or stop the timer.
            If dismiss is true, the function clears the interval timer and returns. If dismiss is false, the function
            sets the interval timer to start the countdown timer.

            <h5>Answer is:</h5>
            The chooseQuiz() function is designed to update the answers array with a user's answer to a specific quiz
            question. Here's how it works: <br> <br>

            First, it checks if the quiz question already exists in the answers array by using the find method on
            answers. If it finds a matching quiz, it stores the quiz object in the isExist variable.
            If the quiz already exists in the answers array, the function searches for the index of the quiz in the
            array using a for loop. If it finds the quiz, it replaces the quiz object with a new object that includes
            the user's new answer. <br> <br>
            If the quiz does not already exist in the answers array, the function creates a new object that includes the
            quiz data at the given index and the user's answer and adds it to the answers array using the push method.
            <br> <br>
            Finally, the function calls displayAnswers with the updated answers array, presumably to show the user their
            updated answers.
